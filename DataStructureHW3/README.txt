	Was unable to get JUnit Tester to find my objects, continuously got "cannot find symbols" error. Did test everything using Startup.java, and it seemed to work fine. Included testers, all very straightforward and should properly function, though I cannot see for myself. I will be bringing my laptop to the Java HelpDesk to resolve this issue ASAP. Most tested functionality is using an empty list and adding elements into the empty list, other contructors not as thouroughly tested.

Thank you,
