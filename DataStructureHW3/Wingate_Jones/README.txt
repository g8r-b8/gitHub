****************NEW UPDATE*************************

I was finally ale to get JUnit Runnere working. I used 4 tests to ensure each function was working properly, and alll of them passed on my end. In the file is evidence of the tester filer running properly, just in case there are any portablility issues. Thank you so much for taking the time to take a look at my work, and for a great semester!

Thanks again!

*****************OLD UPDATE************************

	Was unable to get JUnit Tester to find my objects, continuously got "cannot find symbols" error. Did test everything using Startup.java, and it seemed to work fine. Included testers, all very straightforward and should properly function, though I cannot see for myself. I will be bringing my laptop to the Java HelpDesk to resolve this issue ASAP. Most tested functionality is using an empty list and adding elements into the empty list, other contructors not as thouroughly tested.

Thank you,
Wingate Jones
