Thank you again for you help this weekend, attached is my complex numbers class. Tested, documented and ready to push.

For any complex number represented as a+bi on a floating point numberspace, call methods: add, subtract, multiply and divide to save yourself from banging your head against the wall until you're in a complex analysis class!
